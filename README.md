# SLMC-Script-Starter-Kit
A collection of basic scripts for would-be armorers

The goal of this git is to provide easy access to the fundamentals of the SLMC armory and gear. 
It will include code for creating basic rifles, explosives, etc as well as materials for assembling them.

That said, don't be a talentless hack like Nicole369 Zarco and attempt to resell these under the guise that you made it. 
This is a learning tool. It will not make you a better scripter.

The scripts are provided AS IS and under the BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License.
